## The "MQL Compiler" extension contains several functions for working with MQL files:

1.  Compilation of mq4 / mq5 files.

    (MT4 / MT5 is NOT updated).

2.  Compiling mq4/mq5 files using the "AutoHotkey" script (the idea is taken from [here](https://www.mql5.com/en/blogs/post/719548/page2#comment_16501434)). 
    The script opens the "mq4/mq5" file in "MetaEditor"and presses the "Compile" button, thus MT4/MT5 auto-updates occurs.

3.  Checking mq4 / mq5 files (checking syntax without compiling).
